// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
n and n1 are two variables numbers

sum=n+n1




// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
n as variable number 
if n % 2==0
	print (even)
else print (odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

Imput : n n1 n2 n3 n4 are 5 varaibles numbers.

sum= n+n1+n2+n3+n4

AVR=sum/5

Min :n

Max :n

for n through n4

	if cur > max
		cur=max
	if cur < min
		cur=min
Output: 
print (AVR)

print (Min)
print (Max)
